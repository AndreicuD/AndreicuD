# Hey 👋

I'm Huțanu Andrei, a student at "Tudor Vianu" National High School of Computer Science. I have a few too many hobbies for my own good, but I try to balance them all as best as I can :D

## What am I working on? 🧑‍💻

- 🎮 Right now I'm exploring Godot by creating a small 2D game. You can follow the progress I make [here](https://github.com/AndreicuD/Gravity-Game-Demo). 
I've used it once before on the 2024 Vianu Game Jam competition, and you can see it [here](https://chadchampion.itch.io/bloody-vlad).

- ⚙️ Also working on my next web project for InfoEducatie 2025.
